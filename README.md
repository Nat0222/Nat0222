Vanished (Crystal Castles) ğŸ©¸ğŸ”ª

In the dark, killer awaits.
To kill a life, life you make.
You do another, death can live.
Just keep on dan(cing), movie you're in.
Smell of your sweat, lures me in.
Your heart, (does) things to me.
Running feet, through my blood.
My ghost inside you, soon will be.

Genesis (Grimes) ğŸŒ¹ğŸ©°

My heart, I never be.
I never see.
I never know.
Oh, heart.
And then it falls.
And then I fall.
And then I know.
