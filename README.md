Vanished (Crystal Castles)
In the dark, killer awaits
To kill a life, life you make
You do another, death can live
Just keep on dan(cing), movie you're in
Smell of your sweat, lures me in
Your heart, (does) things to me
Running feet, through my blood
My ghost inside you, soon will be

Genesis (Grimes)
My heart, I never be
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know
